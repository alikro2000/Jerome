# Jerome - Entry for [Yazd Summer Camp Game Jam 2022](https://irangdi.ircg.ir/-news/newsid/162/%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%af%d9%88%db%8c-%d8%a2%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b2%d8%b4-%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b2%db%8c%e2%80%8c%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%b2%db%8c) held by the [Iran Game Dev Institute](http://irangdi.ircg.ir/)

## Summary

"Jerome" is A 2D platformer game where you control 2 players and they both must reach the goal in order for you to win the game. The screen is vertically divided in 2 sections and each player is located in one. They both move in the same direction & jump simultaneously but you can switch to control only one for a limited time.

## Game Logic

You have 2 players that move in the same direction. You win a level if both of your players reach a WinArea, and you lose if they don't. In some levels, the platforms for the players differ and you have to switch to control only one of them. But each player has only a limited amount of time to be controled on its own. A player whose time runs out, cannot move any more and the level restarts.

## Development Tools

The tools I used to develop this during the jam:

- Unity 2021.3.6f1
- Visual Studio 2022

## Notes

I joined the event a little late and had only about 3.5 hours to make a game (instead of the full 48 hours). The jam's theme was "Symmetry & Stairs". My goal was only to make a working prototype of the main idea of the game and so, I didn't spend much time on developing the visual side of it (I added some documentation to the code after the jam was over).

I decided to release the source in order to get feedback about the implementation, code and design of the game since I wanted to consider the possibility of further developing it later on. Feel free to provide some feedback by opening an issue on GitHub. Thanks! ðŸ˜‰
